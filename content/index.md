Hello mate! This is me, MrXcrypt, and welcome to my digital garden.

This space is a curated archive of my study notes, research, and explorations in Cybersecurity. I also include my medium blogs here which are free in medium.

Itâ€™s a growing repository where I document what I learn, break things apart, and put them back togetherâ€”sometimes better, sometimes just to understand them deeper.

My interests revolve around:

- Cyber Threat Intelligence â€“ Tracking threat actors, scams, and financial fraud.
- OSINT & Social Engineering â€“ Gathering intelligence from the wild.
- Financial Analytics & Cybercrime Research â€“ Understanding fraud at scale.

This digital garden is my evolving map of knowledgeâ€”scattered, structured, and always growing. Feel free to explore! ðŸš€
