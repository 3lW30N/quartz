## FENRIR

This is the 3rd [tool](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Fenrir)  #tool created by Neo23x0 (Florian Roth). The previous 2 are named above. The updated version was created to address the issue from its predecessors, where requirements must be met for them to function.

## YAYA (_Yet Another Yara Automaton_)

YAYA #tool was created by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/introducing-yaya-new-threat-hunting-tool-eff-threat-lab) (_Electronic Frontier Foundation_). "_YAYA is a new open-source tool to help researchers manage multiple YARA rule repositories. YAYA starts by importing a set of high-quality YARA rules and then lets researchers add their own rules, disable specific rulesets, and run scans of files._"
