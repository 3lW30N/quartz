# YARA Rules

[Writing Yara Rules](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html)

Some Conditions below:
1. Meta
2. Strings
3. Conditions
4. Keywords

#### Meta

Meta condition is like metadata for the yara rule. We can use `desc`, short for description. It's like commenting code, to summarize the rule.

#### Strings

We can use strings to search for specific text or hexadecimal in files or programs. ==For example,== say we wanted to search a directory for all files containing "Hello World!", we would create a rule such as below:

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"
		
	condition:
		$hello_world
}
```

- Stored inside the variable $hello_world.
- Condition to check the value in the variable exists.

==Essentially, if any file has the string "Hello World!" then the rule will match. However, this is literally saying that it will only match if "Hello World!" is found and will not match if "_hello world_" or "_HELLO WORLD_."==

To solve this, the condition `any of them` allows multiple strings to be searched for, like below:  

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"
		$hello_world_lowercase = "hello world"
		$hello_world_uppercase = "HELLO WORLD"

	condition:
		any of them
}
```

#### Conditions

Some Conditions Operators are:

1. **<=** less than or equal to
2. **>=** more than or equal to
3. **!=** not equal to

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
        $hello_world <= 10
}
```

  
The rule will now:

1. Look for the "Hello World!" string  
2. Only say the rule matches if there are <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">less than or equal to ten occurrences</span> of the "Hello World!" string

#### Keywords

Some Keywords are:

1. **and**
2. **not**
3. **or**

Checking files which are **less than** <10 kb and has "Hello World!" 

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!" 
        
        condition:
	        $hello_world and filesize < 10KB 
}
```

### Anatomy of YARA Rule

## YARA Modules

1. Cuckoo Sandbox
2. Python PE

#### Cuckoo

Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated malware analysis environment. This module allows you to generate Yara rules based upon the behaviours discovered from Cuckoo Sandbox. As this environment executes malware, you can create rules on specific behaviours such as runtime strings and the like.

#### Python PE

Python's PE module allows you to create Yara rules from the various sections and elements of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) structure.

This structure is the standard formatting of all executables and DLL files on windows. Including the programming libraries that are used. 

Examining a PE file's contents is an essential technique in malware analysis; this is because behaviours such as cryptography or worming can be largely identified without reverse engineering or execution of the sample.
