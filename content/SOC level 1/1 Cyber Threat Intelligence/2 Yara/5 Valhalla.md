# Valhalla

_[Valhalla](https://valhalla.nextron-systems.com/) boosts your detection capabilities with the power of thousands of hand-crafted high-quality YARA rules._

We should denote that we can conduct searches based on a keyword, tag, ATT&CK technique, sha256, or rule name.

We are provided with the name of the rule, a brief description, a reference link for more information about the rule, along with the rule date.

Some security professionals may not know how to code/script/read code. So In such situation, We can use Valhalla for some threat intelligence gathering to conduct further research regarding these files to receive approval to eradicate these files from the network.

==We can use Valhalla and VT to get most of the information of the specific file==
