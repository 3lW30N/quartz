> [PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com) seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

The core features include:

- **Perform email analysis:** PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the emailâ€™s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.
- **Heuristic intelligence:** OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a target.
- **Classification and reporting:** Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be shared.
