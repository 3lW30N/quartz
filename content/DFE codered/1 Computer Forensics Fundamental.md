# Computer Forensics:

Computer forensics refer to a set of methodological procedures and techniques that  
help identify, gather, preserve, extract, interpret, document, and present evidence from computing equipment, such that any discovered evidence is acceptable during a legal and/or administrative proceeding  
  

## Understand Digital Evidence:

Digital evidence is defined as "any information of probative value that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form".  
Digital evidence is circumstantial and fragile in nature,which makes it difficult for a forensic investigator to trace criminal activities.  
According to Locard's Exchange Principle, "anyone or anything, entering a crime scene takes something of the scene with them, and leaves something of themselves behind when they leave”.  

### Sources of Potential Evidence:

User-Created Files

User-Protected Files

Computer-Created Files

### Rules of Evidence:

1. Understandable - clear to the judges
2. Admissible - related to the fact
3. Authentic - real and related to the incident
4. Reliable - no doubt about the authenticity & veracity of evidence
5. Complete - must prove actions or innocence

“Original Evidence is the best Evidence”

## Forensic Readiness:

It refers to an organization’s ability to optimally use a digital evidence in a limited period of time and with minimal investigation costs.

### Forensic readiness planning:

It refers to a set of processes to be followed to achieve and maintain forensic readiness.

1. Identify the potential evidence required for an incident
2. Determine the sources of evidence
3. Define a policy that determines the pathway to legally extract electronic evidence with minimal disruption.
4. Establish a policy to handle and store the acquired evidence in a secure  
    manner.  
    
5. Identify if the incident requires full or formal investigation.
6. Create a process for documenting the procedure.
7. Establish a legal advisory board to guide the investigation process.
8. Keep an incident response team ready to review the incident and preserve  
    the evidence.
