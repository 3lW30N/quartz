# OSINT

OSINT stands for open source intelligence and refers to the practice of collecting data from free sources that are available to the general public. As information becomes more available from a vast number of sources, skilled researchers can often find nearly any type of data they’re looking for, provided they know where to look. These sources include both public and private databases that hackers, journalists, spies, and ordinary people all use to do the work of collecting information every day.  
  
Much of this information simply isn’t able to be retrieved through search engines and requires knowledge of where the right database is located to get the right answers. Fortunately, there are a multitude of tools that both beginners and seasoned investigators can take advantage of to use OSINT sources while conducting research.  

# OSINT Techniques

OSINT tactics can be divided into active and passive techniques, with active tactics involving some sort of actual contact with the target, and passive tactics avoiding any contact with the target. Active techniques always involve some small risk of the target detecting you are investigating them, whereas passive tactics usually involve querying a database maintained by someone else, and usually do not involve any risk of being detected.

An active OSINT tactic could be as simple as scanning a website or web server owned by a target, or registering to download a competitor’s product catalog. While this small contact probably won’t blow your investigation, matching a download to your organization’s IP address could tip off a subject that your organization is investigating. Comparatively, a passive technique like using a search engine like Shodan to examine services a company is running without scanning them yourself would be nearly impossible for the target to detect.

# There are 4 stages of OSINT

Planning

Collection

Processing & Exploitation

Production

Dissemination & integration

## 1. Planning and Direction

The first step in the OSINT cycle involves planning the priorities  
and requirements for the mission. Prior to collecting OSINT, operators  
should have a clear understanding of the types of information they need,  

how to find those sources, and what they hope to accomplish with the  
acquired information. These precautionary logistics will guarantee the  
productivity and efficiency of the operation during the next phases of  
the OSINT cycle.  

## 2. Collection

After proper planning has occurred, the collection of OSINT can  
begin. OSINT resources include any materials that are freely available  
online, such as news articles, social media posts, and blogs. Teams can  
utilize their preferred collection tools and resources to obtain this  
data.  

## 3. Processing and Exploitation

Once you’ve acquired your data, you can start processing the  
information. Then, you’ll want to compile it into a common evidence  
repository, timeline, or report. In this stage, you’re simplifying the  
content you’ve found and making it legible for the recipients of the  
data. Processing the data will help analysts utilize the information  
more efficiently in the following steps of the OSINT cycle.  

## 4. Analysis and Production

After the initial processing of the collected data, your teams will  
then need to perform an in-depth analysis of the information. This is a  
crucial step in the OSINT cycle. as it will allow your teams to use the  
data they’ve acquired to interpret and anticipate events. Operators can  
organize their analyzed information into a detailed document or  
presentation, which will be read by a designated audience.  

## 5. Dissemination and Integration

The final step in the OSINT cycle entails delivering the collected  
and analyzed intelligence to the proper stakeholders. Analysts then  
receive feedback, which dictates whether the OSINT cycle should begin  
again.
