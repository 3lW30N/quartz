A Little About Me:
==================

I am a final year engineering student and a Cyber Threat Intel Analyst Intern in a cybersecurity company. I have worked in this intern position for the past one and a half years (22 months). I wanted to share stuff that would have been useful to me when I first started cybersecurity. This series will be helpful to all beginners who want to start a career in cybersecurity and to people who want to know what cybersecurity is all about.

Cybersecurity & its Specializations:
====================================

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyberattacks. Cybersecurity as a common word will include all the topics like hacking, defending, forensics, etc. As a member of this cybersecurity community, you should have a clear idea of what you should become in this vast area of cybersecurity. To know and try everything, I have categorized all the specializations that may be included in cybersecurity. By reading this, You will understand the opportunities you have in this industry and what job role will suit you.

Categories in Cybersecurity:
============================

Cybersecurity is a broad field, and for beginners, it can be divided into several key categories:

1. Offensive Security (Attack)
-------------------------------

Offensive Security is about Ethical hacking. This is where we hack into systems, networks, software, etc., to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. This is the initial starting point for all the beginners in cybersecurity. If you are new to this field, start by trying offensive security to elevate your career to other categories. You should learn the technical part of this computer and internet world to be a master in this. But It is very much recommended to start your cybersecurity journey as a technical person. If you see all the big brains of cybersecurity today, you will find that most of them are from “System Administrator” background. This is where these people get hands-on experience in systems, networks, and servers. By this, they learn a lot about the technical aspects of the system.

Threat Intelligence is an interesting category in Cybersecurity. To be honest, I didn’t know about Threat Intelligence until I joined this company. Nobody told me about threat intelligence and its importance in the cyber world when I first started in Cybersecurity.

Threat Intelligence involves gathering and analyzing data to predict and prevent attacks. The goal is to gather data about potential and existing threats to help organizations make informed decisions on how to defend against cyberattacks. It is about knowing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use, their motivations, and their targets. To be sophisticated in this category, you need to be updated in cyberspace, and constantly monitor different types of threats and threat actors relevant to your organization. Dark web monitoring and Telegram monitoring are key aspects of Threat Intelligence.

**Example Job Roles:**

*   Threat Intelligence Analyst
*   Vulnerability Analyst
*   Cyber Threat Researcher

**Where to Start:**

Start by learning about different types of cyber threats that exist. Learn OSINT tools such as Maltego, Shodan, Fofa. Analytical thinking, knowledge of scripting languages (Python is very useful), and data analysis skills are crucial for threat intelligence.
